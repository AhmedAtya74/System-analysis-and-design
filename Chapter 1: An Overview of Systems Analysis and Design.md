### Software Development and Systems Analysis and Design
**Information system:** a set of interrelated components that collect, process, store, and provide as output the information needed to complete business tasks.

**Computer application or app:** a computer software program that executes on a computing device to carry out a specific function or set of related functions.

Remember that an information system includes people and their manual procedures and an application usually refers just to the software.

**Systems analysis:** those activities that enable a person to understand and specify what the new system should accomplish.

**Systems design:** consists of those activities that enable a person to describe in detail how the information system will actually be implemented to provide the needed solution.

**NOTE:** Systems analysis and design plays an **integral role** in the development of information systems.

> ### Systems analyst do:
> - planning, capturing the vision.
> - understanding details.
> - specifying needs—before designing and writing the code that satisfies the vision.

> **What analysis and design provides for the system developer:**
> - Understand the need (business need).
> - Capture the vision.
> - Define a solution.
> - Communicate the vision and the solution.
> - Build the solution or direct others in building the solution.
> - Confirm that the solution meets the need.
> - Launch the solution application.

### The System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
**Project:** a planned undertaking that has a beginning and an end and produces some end result.

**System development life cycle (SDLC):** a framework that identifies all the activities required to research, build, deploy, and often maintain an information system.

> ### The six core processes required in the development of any information system:
> - Identify the problem or need and obtain approval
> - Plan and monitor the project
> - Discover and understand the details of the problem
> - Build, test, and integrate system components
> - Complete system tests and then deploy the solution

**System development process or methodology:** a set of comprehensive guidelines for carrying out all of the activities of each core process of the SDLC.


### Agile Development
**Agile development:** an information system development process that emphasizes flexibility and rapid response to anticipate new and changing requirements during development.


### Iterative Development

**Iterative development:** an approach to system development in which the system is “grown” piece by piece through multiple miniprojects called iterations

> ### There are several benefits to iterative development:
>
> 1. Portions of the system can sometimes be deployed sooner. If there are core functions that provide basic support for users, these can be deployed in an early iteration.
> 2. taking a small portion and developing it first, the most difficult problems can be identified and addressed early in the project.

**NOTE:** A key element of iterative development is dividing system components into pieces that can be completed in two to four weeks.

### Waterfall Development
