Chapter Two: Investigating System Requirements

Six core processes for system development life cycle (SDLC):

1- Identify the problem and obtain approval.

2- Plan and monitor the project.

3- . Discover and understand the details of the problem.

4- Design the system components that satisfy the need.

5- Build, test, and integrate system components.

6- Complete system tests and then deploy the solution.
	

This blog concentrates on systems analysis activities (Core Process 3) and cover a wider range of concepts, tools, and techniques.

Terminology:

Technology architecture:

the set of computing hardware, network hardware and topology, and system softwareâ€”such as operating and database management systems employed by an organization
		 

Application architecture:

the set of information systems (the software applications) the organization needs to support its strategic plan.


Systems Analysis Activities:

 the activities of the third core process, which is to discover and understand the details, The activities are as follows:

 1- Gather detailed information:
 
Systems analysts obtain information from people who will be using the system and 
read nearly everything available about the existing system and obtain additional information by reviewing planning documents
and policy statements and study existing systems, including their documentation and 
looking at what other companies (particularly vendors) have done when faced with a similar business need.
The analyst must become an expert in the business area the system will support.
For example, if you are implementing an order-entry system, you need to become an expert on the way orders are processed
 
 2- Define requirements:

The analyst uses information gathered from users and documents to define
requirements for the new system. System requirements include the functions the
system must perform.
Defining requirements is not just a matter of writing down facts and figures.
Instead, the analyst creates models to record requirements, reviews the models with users and others, and refines and expands the models to reflect new
or updated information
 
 3- Prioritize requirements:
 
Once the system requirements are well understood, it is important to establish
which requirements are most crucial for the system. Sometimes, users request
additional system functions that are desirable but not essential. However, users
and analysts need to ask themselves which functions are truly important and
which are fairly important but not absolutely required.

Why prioritize the functions requested by the users?
Resources are always limited and also help to determine the number, composition, and ordering of project iterations. High-priority requirements are often incorporated into early project iterations

If system requirements tend to expand as users make more suggestions called SCOPE CREEP

 4- Develop user-interface dialogs:
 
Users tend to be uncertain of many aspects of system requirements. Such requirements
models as use cases, activity diagrams, and interaction diagrams can be developed based on user input, but it is often difficult for users to interpret and validate such abstract models.

requirements models as use cases, activity diagrams, and interaction diagrams

In comparison, user validation of a user interface is much simpler and more
reliable because the user can see and feel the system. To most users, the user
interface is all that matters. Thus, developing user-interface dialogs is a powerful
method of eliciting and documenting requirements.

 5- Evaluate requirements with users:
 
 The processes of eliciting requirements, building models and prototypes, and evaluating them with users may repeat many times until requirements models and prototypes are complete and accurate.
