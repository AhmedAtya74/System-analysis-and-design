# Review Question
## Designing Application Components:
> ## There are two approach for design Component Boundaries of the system:
> - With top-down approach, the designer thinks of the entire system as a single component performing all of the functions.
> - With the bottom-up approach, the designer considers each function separately.
> - With either approach, the designer looks for similarities among system functions to guide factoring or grouping but HOW ?
> > - **Actors:** Each use case identifies one or more specific actors. Software for use cases that interact with the same actors is a candidate for grouping into a single application component.
> > - **Shared data:** Use cases that interact with the same domain class(es) are candidates for grouping into a single application component.
> > - **Events:** Use cases that are triggered by the same external, temporal, or state event are candidates for grouping into a single application component.
