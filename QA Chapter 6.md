# REVIEW Questions:

1. How does the objective of systems analysis differ from the objective of systems design?
> - Analysis involves decomposition. Analysts then organize, structure, and document the problem domain knowledge by building requirements models
Requires extensive user involvement to explain the requirements and to verify that the models are accurate
> - Design is much more oriented towards technical issues, and therefore require less user involvement and more involvement by other systems professionals
Output of design activities is a set of diagrams and documents that models various aspects of the solution system

2. What are the inputs to systems design? What are the outputs?
> - the inputs to system design is system analysis and the outputs is system design.

3. On a project that uses iterations to develop the system, in which iteration does system design begin?
> - When iterative approach of SLDC is used, major design decisions are made in the first or second iteration; however, many decisions are revisited and refined during later iterations

4. List at least three examples of application components?
> - 1. Web Sites
> - 2. Java
> - 3. C#

5. Why is the singular form of the term 'user interface' usually a misnomer?
> - Designing a single user interface is now the exception, not the norm.
Ever-improving technology expands and changes user-interface requirements. A decade ago, user-interface design was concerned primarily with simplifying the presentation of information on desktop computer monitors and minimizing task-related keystrokes and mouse clicks. In the modern world, designers must deal with multiple screens ranging from phones to large monitor displays.

6. Why is the environment "DESCRIBED" while other key design elements such as the user interface and database are "designed"?
> - The designer of a single system has little or no control over the environment

7. Designing security and controls impacts the design of which other elements?
> - Because they are embedded in all other design activities, securities and controls are important parts of activities such as designing a user interface, a database, or application components.

8. a key task in defining security controls is?
> - 1. Determining which operating system security features will be enabled
> - 2. How they will be configured.

9- What are the two primary objectives of security controls?
>- 1. Maintain a stable, functioning operating environment for users and application systems (most common security control is firewall)
> - 2. Protect Information and transactions during transmission across insecure environments such as public wireless networks and the internet

10. Significant problem with Symmetric Key Encryption?
> - 1. The sender and receiver use the same key, which must be created and shared securely
> - 2. Security is compromised if the key is transmitted over the same channel as messages encrypted with the key
> - 3. Sharing a key among many users increases the possibility of key theft



## TIPS:
**Access Controls:** A control that limits a user's ability to access resources, such as servers, files, Web pages, application programs, and database tables.

**Access control list:** A list attached or linked to a specific resource that describes users or user groups and the nature of permitting access.

**Fraud Prevention:** Prevent it. 

**Fraud triangle:** a model of fraud that states that opportunity, motivation, and rationalization must all exist for a fraud to occur

**IP Security (IPSec):** Internet standard for secure transmission of low-level network packets.

**Digital Certificate:** An institutions name and public key encrypted and certified by a third party

**Digital Signature:** Technique in which a document is encrypted by using a private key to verify who wrote the document

**Remote Wipe:** A security measure that automatically deletes sensitive data from a portable device when unauthorized accesses are attempted

**Cowboy Coding:** A developer who jumps into writing software without carefully thinking it through ends up with errors, patches, and systems that are unreliable and difficult to update

**Design Activity Inputs:** Consist of the models that were built during analysis
